Having the expected results in the tree keeps them consistent with the driver code itself, and allows putting in place gating CI to prevent merging driver changes which make any of the tests deviate from the expected result.

Keeping them separate inevitably results in divergence between the driver code and the expected test results, which would result in spurious failures of such CI.


I expect the main complication for the kernel will be due to driver changes merged via different trees, e.g. for cross-subsystem reworks. Since those will not go through the same CI, they may accidentally introduce inconsistencies. The ideal solution for this IMO would be centralizing CI such that the same gating tests have to pass regardless of how the code is merged. But there's likely quite a long way to go until we get there. :)
