Ah, gotcha. Thanks for the explanation.

If we moved the RESUME+CFIE into the interrupt handler after the call
to report_iommu_fault(), would it be possible to run the handler as a
threaded irq (see 'context_fault_needs_threaded_irq') and handle the
callback synchronously? In that case, I think we could avoid taking the
lock if we wrote CFIE _before_ RESUME.
